        <h1>The Tale of Arthur</h1>
        <p>Arthur, the rat terrier born in the roadside shitshow of Rio Vista, California. Arthur was living a life full of fleas until one day, some dumb bitch with a dumb impulse to obtain a dog found him on Craigslist and took him in. He sees this dumb bitch as his savior of Rio Vista, and therefore annoys her every chance he gets, as a thank you.</p>
        <p>Does Arthur suck? Well, he has many sins. And I am here to rat on him for it. Get it. Rat. He's a rat.</p>
